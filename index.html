var textnode = document.createTextNode("Lorem Ipsum is unadulterated drivel. It means nothing whatsoever, but it's surprisingly useful. The main idea behind lorem ipsum is to have 'convincing' text, separated into words, paragraphs and with punctuation etc. This 'text' is then used by DTP bureaux and web designers for roughing out document designs, illustrating text flow and run arounds before the final text arrives. It allows designers to show their proposals without having clients distracted by meaningful text. It also avoids fine publications like N.T.K. detecting irony which may become apparent in old web page drafts loitering around dusty servers which had English-language garbage text used as filler. A FOLDOC definition of lorem ipsum is here.");         // Create a text node
node.appendChild(textnode);                              // Append the text to <li>
